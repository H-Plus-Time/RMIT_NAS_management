      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Sign in to create/update your retailer profile, and start pushing out deals. Please note that
      for security purposes, you should have received an invitation email (this lets us pick and 
      choose who can set up a profile) - if you don't have one, signing in won't do you much good.
      </p>
      <p>You can sign in via email, or via your Google account if you have one.</p>

      Now, once you're signed in, head over to Profile and hit edit. We need the following information
      from you:
      <ol>
        <li>Your trading name (company/establishment - e.g. Grill'd)</li>
        <li>Address. If you are in, or very close (5m - 10m) to, an RMIT building, entering
          Building XX should give you a list of autocomplete suggestions.
        </li>
        <li>A tagline, something that briefly distinguishes your business - e.g. Korean Restaurant, Vegan Delicatessen, etc</li>
        <li>Detailed description: 'Offering a range of delicious snacks and drinks, XYZ'. No more than ~2 tweets.</li>
        <li>Your company logo.</li>
        <li>Operating hours - Monday to Friday is prepopulated with the usual 9AM-5PM. The tab key is your friend for this one</li>
      </ol>

      Optional, but recommended, information:
      <ul>
        <li>Level - include if you're in an RMIT building. Keep in mind that 'ground level' varies due to the many basement levels
          in some of the buildings</li>
        <li>A link to your website, if you have one.</li>
        <li>Images of your menus. Up to 7, maximum 3MB each, jpeg or png format,
          minimum resolution 414wx722h, maximum resolution 1080wx1883h</li>
        <li>Banner images - photos of your venue, menu items, etc.
          Up to 7, maximum 3MB each, jpeg or png format, minimum resolution 375wx300h,
          maximum resolution 1080wx864h</li>
      </ul>

      For the images, its best to keep them about the same aspect ratio as the maximum/minimum
      resolutions (i.e. 4:3 banners, 1:1.8 menus), otherwise they'll exhibit letterboxing.
      <br>
      Once that's all done, you can send out deals via the Offers tab. Creating an offer is quite straightforward:
      <ol>
        <li>Hit the 'Create an offer' button</li>
        <li>Select an image (in a rush, your logo works well)</li>
        <li>Enter the offer title, e.g. 'Cruffins @ Coffee Nomad'</li>
        <li>Enter a short, enticing tagline, e.g. 'Hurry, stocks limited!'</li>
        <li>Enter a longer (1 tweet equivalent) description</li>
        <li>Enter a start and end datetime - these are prefilled to your current time and 24 hours
          after that.</li>
        <li>Hit submit (the button enables as soon as everything's filled out)</li>
      </ol>

      <!--<p>-->
        Once you hit submit, if the start time is less than an hour from your current time, a push notification
        is sent immediately. If not, it'll send 1 hour before the start time.

        As always, if you notice any bugs, head over to <a href="https://github.com/H-Plus-Time/rmit-nas-mgmt/issues">Github</a> 
        and file an issue. Otherwise, enjoy!
